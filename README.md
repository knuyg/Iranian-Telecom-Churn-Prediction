# Customer Churn Prediction Exercise


## Introduction

This repository contains my first churn prediction project, which was aimed at gaining a fundamental understanding of the tasks and techniques involved in churn prediction. Before applying this knowledge to my actual job, I wanted to create a practical example to learn and experiment.

## Background

Customer churn prediction is a crucial aspect of customer relationship management. It involves identifying and predicting when customers are likely to leave or discontinue using a service or product. Churn prediction is a valuable tool for businesses to retain and engage their customer base effectively.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to:

1. **Learn the Basics:** Acquire a foundational understanding of the data science and machine learning techniques involved in churn prediction.

2. **Experiment:** Apply and experiment with different models and methods to predict customer churn effectively.

3. **Prepare for Real-World Application:** Use this project as a stepping stone to apply churn prediction in my actual job, helping to reduce customer churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Contents

This repository includes:

- Jupyter Notebooks with code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and various churn prediction models.
- Datasets used for this project (if allowed by the data's licensing).
- Documentation and reports summarizing the project's findings and results.

## Dependencies

To run the code and experiments in this project, you'll need the following libraries and dependencies:

- Python (version X.X)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or another package manager.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn [other_dependencies]
